gitData Setup Guide

This analysis requires 3 CSV data files to run. Follow these steps to set up your environment.

STEP 1: CREATE DATA FOLDER

Create a folder named "Datasets" in your project directory (same location as the notebook file).

Windows/Mac: Right-click > New Folder > Name it "Datasets"
Command Line: mkdir Datasets

STEP 2: REQUIRED DATA FILES

You need these 3 files in your Datasets folder:

File 1: historical_data_2000_2022_filtered.csv
- Contains: Pesticide usage records for California counties
- Size: ~1.1 million records (80-120 MB)
- Columns: YEAR, CHEM_CODE, TOTAL_LBS_AI, TOTAL_ACRES_TREATED, COUNTY_NAME

File 2: copd_aqi_poverty_demographics.csv
- Contains: Health outcomes and demographic data
- Size: ~1,300 rows (100-200 KB)
- Columns: Counties, Year, Median AQI, age demographics, race/ethnicity percentages, COPD_Hospitalization_Rate (target variable), poverty and income data

File 3: Population_Census_Numbers_2000_2025.csv
- Contains: County population data by year
- Size: ~1,500 rows (50-100 KB)
- IMPORTANT: This file comes as a ZIP archive and must be extracted before use
- Extract the ZIP file into your Datasets folder

STEP 3: VERIFY FOLDER STRUCTURE

Your project should look like this:

your-project-folder/
    XGBoost_pesticide_copd_analysis_Completed.ipynb
    requirements.txt
    DATA_SETUP.md
    .gitignore
    Datasets/
        historical_data_2000_2022_filtered.csv
        copd_aqi_poverty_demographics.csv
        Population_Census_Numbers_2000_2025.csv

STEP 4: UPDATE NOTEBOOK PATHS

Open the notebook and go to Cell 2. Replace the long file paths with:

df_pesticides2 = pd.read_csv('Datasets/historical_data_2000_2022_filtered.csv')
df_confounders = pd.read_csv('Datasets/copd_aqi_poverty_demographics.csv')
df_population = pd.read_csv('Datasets/Population_Census_Numbers_2000_2025.csv')

Save the notebook after making changes.

DATA SOURCES

Pesticide data: California Department of Pesticide Regulation (https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/purmain.htm)
Health data: California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal (https://data.chhs.ca.gov/)
Demographics: U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/data.html)
Air quality: EPA Air Quality System (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data)

ANALYSIS COVERAGE

Geographic: 53 California counties (excludes Alpine, Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Sierra due to missing data)
Time period: 2000-2022 raw data, 2005-2022 for analysis
Total observations: 943 county-year combinations after cleaning

TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: FileNotFoundError
Solution: Check that files are in Datasets folder, file names match exactly (including capitalization), and you updated the notebook paths

Problem: ZIP file won't extract
Solution: Right-click > Extract All (Windows) or double-click (Mac), then move CSV to Datasets folder

Problem: ModuleNotFoundError
Solution: Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install required packages

Problem: Incorrect results
Solution: Verify all 3 files are correct, population file was extracted from ZIP, files are from 2000-2022 time period

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Python 3.8 or higher
4 GB RAM minimum (8 GB recommended)
500 MB free storage
Expected runtime: 30-60 seconds

INSTALLATION

Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook:
Open XGBoost_pesticide_copd_analysis_Completed.ipynb and run all cells
